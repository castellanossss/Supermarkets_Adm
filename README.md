  If you want to exit, that's ok, seriusly, just type 2 in the field box and the app will close  
  
  If you want to register a new Customer or Supplier or Product or Sale, select the respective option and the app will ask you for the necesary data.

  If you want to exit, that's completely fine, just type 2 in the field box and the app will close  
    
  But... If you want to keep adding data and so on, type 1 in the field box and you will be right back at the second menu, cool isn't it?
